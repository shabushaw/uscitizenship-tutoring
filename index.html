        <div>
          <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Dan. I was born overseas but became a naturalized U.S. citizen after going through the process myself â€” without a tutor or dedicated help â€” and realized how valuable it would have been to have someone guide me through it. Iâ€™m college and graduate school educated in the United States, and Iâ€™m passionate about helping others succeed in this journey.</p>
          <p>Thatâ€™s why I created this in-person tutoring service: to help others who are on the same path. Each session is designed to make the process easier and to give you the confidence you need to pass your naturalization test. My goal is to share practical tips, answer your questions, and provide personal guidance every step of the way.</p>
